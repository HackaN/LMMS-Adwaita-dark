# LMMS-Adwaita-dark
My take on making LMMS blend in with the GNOME desktop

Most of the icons are still LMMS original, I have yet only changed a few. The heavy work is the css and the splash.
There are still kinks that I am working on and I would like to work more with icons later on - so I'll keep updating this theme!


## Installation

1) Clone or download zip and extract _LMMS-Adwaita-dark-master_
2) In LMMS, open settings -> folders and point the theme folder to wherever you put _LMMS-Adwaita-dark-master_
3) Relaunch LMMS
